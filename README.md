# wipeclean

tired of the old and unintresting clear commande ? 
Do you want your error messages to be slowly wiped away ?
Then try wipeclean!

## Install
`npm install wipeclean -g`  

Or if using arch linux, install with an AUR helper like yay: 
`yay -S wipeclean` 
Note that this is an unofficial package not created by the original developer.
